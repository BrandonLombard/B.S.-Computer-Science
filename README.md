1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app was developed for Weight Loss tracking. It allows the user to set a goal weight, have a history of their weight, and set notifications if they meet their goal weight. It allows people of all types to track their weight, whether it be to lose or even gain weight.

3. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

There were multiple features that were important for this app to support user needs. We needed multiple elements, from a login screen to keep your weight information private, to a database to keep track of user information such as their weight and login information. I kept the UI mostly simple, so that the user was not overwhelmed. I believe these were successful because the application is easy to use and has a nice UI.

4. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I honestly went slow in the development of this ansd took my time. There were quite a few requirements so I believe taking my time and conducting a lot of research would be beneficial. I used a lot of Youtube Tutorials to help me understand the concepts here, and I believe in the future I will use these tutorials more to help me understand concepts that I am studying.

5. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Testing was a long process. I tested every aspect of this app on a regular basis. Every time I would add a new feature, I would test it until it was working. This is highly important because you want a functioning product for the end user. Frequent testing helps the developer to fix bugs as they go, and perhaps have less of a headache towards the end. It revealed many errors that I had to work through in this project, and showed me how important testing is.

6. Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I've had to innovate multiple times over the duration of this project. Primarily, I decided to change the UI of my app to be more appealing in my final project, and have a better system. This was a huge overhaul as I completely re-designed my app for the final project.

7. In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe the history section was well-developed on my end, although I struggled to complete it. I believe this was my most successful element in showing both my design and database development skills.
