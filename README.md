# B.S.-Computer-Science
Work from my the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science With a Focus in Software Engineering program at SNHU.

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   I have included three projects within this repository. The first project involved having LEDs on the TI board blink different colors depending on which button was pressed on the board itself. The second project I added was one that output SOS or OK depending on which button was pressed. This included timers and interrupts to see which message would be displayed through LEDs on the board. At first, I had a difficult time understanding how to configure the state machine, but after further research and study, I was able to accomplish this task. Finally, my last project involved reading the temperature sensor and outputting the if the heat was increasing or decreasing depending on the set heat point. Also, interrupts were utilized to change the temperature menually with use of the buttons on the side of the TI board. Additionally, this project used timers to check the temperature and timer flags every 200-500ms. 
   
3. What did you do particularly well?
   I believe I was able to create readable and usable code best. This is because I rely on using software development best practices in all of my progrmaming projects. This is really important to me as a developer so that I can always look back at my code and know what is happening within each piece of code. It is also great for others who look at your code.
   
5. Where could you improve?
   In particular, I have trouble using timers in some of my projects. The second project with the SOS message I used usleep() instead of the correct timer for this project. Primarily, I could improve on how I utilize timers.
   
6. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
   I plan to continue to use Code Composer Studio and plan to do some more TI board projects in the future. I found these projects to not only be difficult, but entertaining as well. I enjoyed the challenges and constant errors I had to work through to get the projects to function properly. Additionally, I found the documentation to be very useful in ensuring I had working projects. In the future, I will continue to use these documentations for my Code Composer projects.

8. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
   These projects allowed me to understand programming with C and creating programs with Code Composer Studio. Additionally, it allowed me to learn about programming emerging systems to create blinking LED's with timers, using state machines, reading temperature, outputting results, etc. I believe that these projects also helped me in further understanding how to research errors within my code and creating logical conclusions in my problem solving methods. This will help everywhere in software development / programming as a lot of it involves problem solving. 
   
9. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   These projectd are easily maintainable, readable and adaptable because I used software development best practices including commenting and formatting. Also, I used state machines to allow easy-editing of the projects if needed. With these best practices in place, the code may be adapted to improve the overall performance of it.
